You clicked the back button on the Edit Profile page.
GoRouter threw an error: "There is nothing to pop".
Why This Happens
context.pop() (from GoRouter) tries to pop the current route.
If the Edit Profile page was not pushed onto the stack (e.g., you navigated there via go() instead of push()), there is nothing to pop, so GoRouter throws this error.
This is a common issue when using declarative navigation (GoRouter) and not always pushing pages onto the stack.
How to Fix
Best Practice:
Use context.canPop() to check if there is a route to pop.
If not, navigate to a fallback route (e.g., profile or home).
Example:
This will pop if possible, otherwise go to the profile page.
Action Plan
Update the back button logic in EditProfileScreen as above.

Always keep in mind to Apply the same pattern to other pages for consistent back navigation.
